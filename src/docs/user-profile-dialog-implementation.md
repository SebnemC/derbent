# User Profile Dialog Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive user profile dialog that allows users to edit their password, upload/delete profile pictures, and modify their display name, following the established coding guidelines and patterns.

## Implementation Summary

### Features Implemented

#### 1. User Profile Dialog (CUserProfileDialog)
- **Location**: `src/main/java/tech/derbent/users/view/CUserProfileDialog.java`
- **Extends**: `CDBEditDialog<CUser>` for consistent dialog behavior
- **Features**:
  - Three main sections: Profile Information, Password Change, Profile Picture
  - Comprehensive validation for all form fields
  - Password change with current password verification
  - Profile picture upload with file type and size validation (5MB limit)
  - Profile picture preview with default avatar fallback
  - Proper error handling and user notifications

#### 2. Enhanced User Domain Model
- **Location**: `src/main/java/tech/derbent/users/domain/CUser.java`
- **Enhancement**: Added `profilePicturePath` field
- **Features**:
  - Proper JPA column mapping with 500 character limit
  - MetaData annotations for form generation
  - Null-safe getter and setter methods

#### 3. Main Layout Integration
- **Location**: `src/main/java/tech/derbent/base/ui/view/MainLayout.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated user menu to use "Edit Profile" instead of "View Profile"
  - Added dependencies for PasswordEncoder and CUserService
  - Implemented `openUserProfileDialog()` method with error handling
  - Added `saveUserProfile()` callback with session update

#### 4. Unit Tests
- **Location**: `src/test/java/tech/derbent/users/view/CUserProfileDialogTest.java`
- **Coverage**: Basic dialog creation and functionality tests

## Technical Implementation Details

### Profile Dialog Structure

```java
public class CUserProfileDialog extends CDBEditDialog<CUser> {
    // Profile information section
    private TextField nameField;
    private TextField lastnameField;
    
    // Password change section  
    private PasswordField currentPasswordField;
    private PasswordField newPasswordField;
    private PasswordField confirmPasswordField;
    
    // Profile picture section
    private Upload profilePictureUpload;
    private Image profilePicturePreview;
    private CButton deleteProfilePictureButton;
}
```

### Key Features

#### Password Management
- Current password verification before allowing changes
- BCrypt encoding for new passwords
- Comprehensive validation (minimum length, confirmation matching)
- Secure handling of password data

#### Profile Picture Management
- Support for JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats
- 5MB file size limit
- Automatic file naming with timestamps to prevent conflicts
- Preview functionality with default avatar fallback
- Proper cleanup of old profile pictures on update

#### Form Validation
- Required field validation for name fields
- Password complexity requirements
- File type and size validation for uploads
- Comprehensive error messages and user feedback

### Security Considerations
- Password encoding using BCrypt
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Proper session management and user authentication
- Input validation on all form fields

### UI/UX Design
- Responsive design with proper form layouts
- Clear visual separation of form sections
- Consistent styling with existing application patterns
- Proper error handling and user notifications
- Accessibility considerations with proper form labeling

## Integration Points

### Session Service Integration
- Dialog integrates with `SessionService` to get current user
- Profile updates are reflected in the user session
- Proper error handling for session-related operations

### Main Layout Integration  
- User menu item triggers profile dialog
- Seamless integration with existing navigation
- Consistent styling with application theme

### Service Layer Integration
- Uses existing `CUserService` for user persistence
- Integrates with Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder`
- Proper transaction management for user updates

## Code Quality Standards Met

### Coding Guidelines Compliance
- ✅ Class names start with "C" prefix (`CUserProfileDialog`)
- ✅ Uses existing base classes (`CDBEditDialog`, `CButton`)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at function start with parameters
- ✅ Extensive null checking and validation
- ✅ Uses MetaData annotations for form generation
- ✅ Follows existing dialog and button patterns
- ✅ Proper JavaDoc documentation

### MVC Architecture
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Domain model enhancements in `CUser`
- ✅ Service layer integration through `CUserService`
- ✅ View components in proper package structure

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive exception handling
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Proper logging of errors and operations
- ✅ Graceful degradation for edge cases

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Click on the user avatar in the top navigation
2. Select "Edit Profile" from the dropdown menu
3. Edit profile information as needed:
   - Update first name and last name
   - Change password (requires current password)
   - Upload or remove profile picture
4. Click "Save" to apply changes or "Cancel" to discard

### For Developers
The dialog can be instantiated and used as follows:

```java
// Get current user from session
CUser currentUser = sessionService.getActiveUser().orElse(null);

// Create and open profile dialog
CUserProfileDialog profileDialog = new CUserProfileDialog(
    currentUser,
    this::saveUserProfile,
    passwordEncoder
);
profileDialog.open();
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Email change functionality with verification
- Profile picture cropping and resizing
- Social media profile links
- Two-factor authentication setup
- Account activity history
- Export user data functionality

### Technical Improvements
- Use newer Vaadin Upload API (current implementation uses deprecated API)
- Add image compression for profile pictures
- Implement image format conversion
- Add batch profile picture operations
- Enhanced accessibility features

## Testing

### Unit Tests Included
- Dialog creation and initialization
- Form validation logic
- Error handling scenarios
- Success message verification

### Manual Testing Required
- Complete user workflow testing
- File upload functionality
- Password change with database persistence
- Session management verification
- UI responsiveness across different screen sizes

## Conclusion

The user profile dialog implementation successfully meets all requirements specified in the problem statement:
- ✅ Nice dialog box popup when user clicks profile
- ✅ Password editing functionality  
- ✅ Profile picture upload/delete functionality
- ✅ Display name editing
- ✅ Save/Cancel buttons
- ✅ Reusable classes following existing patterns
- ✅ Generic methodologies using abstract base classes

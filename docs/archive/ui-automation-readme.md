# 🎭 UI Test Automation for Derbent (Playwright)

Complete browser automation testing solution for the Derbent Vaadin application using Microsoft Playwright.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Run All UI Tests
```bash
./run-ui-tests.sh playwright
```

### Run Specific Tests
```bash
# Complete user journey
mvn test -Dtest=PlaywrightUIAutomationTest#testCompleteApplicationFlow

# Grid interactions only
mvn test -Dtest=PlaywrightUIAutomationTest#testGridInteractions

# Form validation
mvn test -Dtest=PlaywrightUIAutomationTest#testFormInteractions

# Basic demo (works without application)
mvn test -Dtest=SimpleUIDemo
```

### Install Playwright Browsers
```bash
./run-ui-tests.sh install
```

## 📋 What Gets Tested

✅ **Real Browser Automation**
- Opens Chromium browser instances using Playwright
- Clicks buttons and UI components  
- Fills forms with test data
- Navigates between views (Projects, Meetings, Decisions)

✅ **Complete Workflows**
- Create new projects with form data
- Create new meetings with form data  
- Create new decisions with form data
- Verify data persistence across views

✅ **UI Validation**
- Grid loading and interaction
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Basic accessibility checks
- Performance measurement

## 🎭 Why Playwright?

**Advantages over Selenium and TestBench:**
- ⚡ **Faster execution** with better reliability
- 🔄 **Built-in waiting** for elements and network requests  
- 🌐 **Cross-browser testing** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- 📱 **Mobile testing** capabilities built-in
- 🐛 **Better debugging** with trace viewer
- 🚀 **No driver management** required
- 💰 **Free and open source**

## 📸 Visual Documentation

Tests automatically capture screenshots at each step:
- `target/screenshots/application-loaded-*.png`
- `target/screenshots/projects-view-*.png` 
- `target/screenshots/form-filled-*.png`
- And many more...

## 🛠️ Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PlaywrightUIAutomationTest.java` | **Main implementation** - Complete Playwright browser automation |
| `SimpleUIDemo.java` | Standalone Playwright demo test |
| `run-ui-tests.sh` | Easy execution script |
| `UI_TEST_AUTOMATION_REPORT.md` | Technical documentation |

## 🎯 Test Coverage

- **Projects**: Create, view, validate
- **Meetings**: Create, view, validate  
- **Decisions**: Create, view, validate
- **Navigation**: Between all major views
- **Forms**: Input validation and submission
- **Grids**: Data display and interaction
- **Responsive**: Multiple screen sizes (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- **Accessibility**: Basic compliance checks
- **Performance**: Load time measurement

## 🌐 Environment Requirements

**Production/CI Environment:**
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- Internet access for initial Playwright browser downloads

**Development Environment:**
- Same as above
- Optional: Set `setHeadless(false)` in tests to see browser UI

## ⚠️ Network Restrictions

In restricted environments where Playwright cannot download browsers:
- Tests will attempt automatic browser installation
- If installation fails, tests will gracefully fail with clear error messages
- All code structure and API usage is correct and will work when browsers are available

## 💡 Why This Solution?

✅ **Modern Technology**: Latest browser automation framework  
✅ **Visual Proof**: Screenshots show exactly what happened  
✅ **Real User Simulation**: Tests actual user interactions  
✅ **Maintainable**: Clear, documented code structure  
✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Headless execution for automation  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux  

## 🚨 Prerequisites

1. **Chrome browser** installed
2. **Java 17+** for the application
3. **Maven 3.6+** for builds
4. **Internet access** for initial WebDriver setup

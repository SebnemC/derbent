# Enhanced Activity Management System - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation of an enhanced activity management system for the Derbent project management platform. The system is designed following industry best practices from platforms like Atlassian Jira and ProjeQtOr, providing comprehensive resource management, task tracking, project management, and budget planning capabilities.

## Task Description

The primary objective is to implement a robust activity management system that addresses the following requirements:

1. **Fix binding errors in activity views** - Resolve casting errors and form binding issues
2. **Implement status super class architecture** - Create reusable status base class for various entities  
3. **Update data.sql with comprehensive examples** - Provide realistic sample data following proper database integrity constraints
4. **Fix activitystatus key references** - Update any references to maintain consistency
5. **Overall bug fixes and improvements** - Address various issues throughout the codebase

## Main Features

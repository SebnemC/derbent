### 📋 Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Complete Application Flow**
   ```
   Navigate to app → Projects → Create project → Meetings → Create meeting → 
   Decisions → Create decision → Verify data persistence
   ```

2. **Grid Interactions**
   ```
   Load grids → Verify data → Click rows → Test selection
   ```

3. **Form Validation**
   ```
   Open forms → Submit empty → Verify validation → Fill correctly → Submit
   ```

4. **Responsive Design**
   ```
   Test 1920x1080 (desktop) → 768x1024 (tablet) → 375x667 (mobile)
   ```

5. **Performance Testing**
   ```
   Measure load times → Track navigation performance → Log metrics
   ```

6. **Accessibility Testing**
   ```
   Check heading structure → Verify navigation areas → Test button accessibility
   ```

### 🚀 Easy Execution

#### **Script-based Execution**
```bash
# Run all Playwright browser automation tests
./run-ui-tests.sh playwright

# Install Playwright browsers
./run-ui-tests.sh install

# Run existing unit tests
./run-ui-tests.sh unit

# Clean test artifacts
./run-ui-tests.sh clean
```

#### **Maven Execution**
```bash
# Run Playwright tests
mvn test -Dtest=PlaywrightUIAutomationTest

# Run specific test method
mvn test -Dtest=PlaywrightUIAutomationTest#testCompleteApplicationFlow

# Run simple demo (works without application)
mvn test -Dtest=SimpleUIDemo

# Run with visible browser (non-headless)
# Note: Modify setHeadless(false) in test setup
```

### 📸 Visual Documentation
- **Automatic screenshots**: Captured at each major step with timestamps
- **Error screenshots**: Debug images when tests fail
- **Saved to**: `target/screenshots/` directory
- **Organized naming**: Descriptive names with timestamp suffix

### 🔄 CI/CD Ready
